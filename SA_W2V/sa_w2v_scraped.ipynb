    "### In this project, we do sentiment analysis on food review data scraped from Yelp. The project contains three main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1) Scrape data from websites of interest\n",

    "### (3) Use self-designed word vectors to do sentiment analysis on scraped data<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Please note that we could also use pre-trained word vectors provided by Standford University to do sentiment analysis in this project. But instead, we mainly focused on training our own word vectors based on the data that we scraped because being able to understand the mathematical foundation behind designing word vectors are much more important than just using pre-trained word vectors. Once we understand it, we can design custom word vectors and apply them to anywhere we want.<br><br>\n",
    " In this project, applying pre-trained word vectors to sentiment analysis was also demonstrated. The results showed that the model using self-trained custom word vectors yielded a slightly higher accuracy than the model using pre-trained word vectors. The gist of this project is that mathematics plays an important role in the field of NLP, or in machine learning in general."

    "According to Yelp reviews, people tend to consider the overall dining experience positive if 4 or 5 stars are given. On the contrary, if 3 stars are given, then generally there is at least one or two minor parts which consumers are not satisfied about. If 1 or 2 stars are given, then generally consumers are sure being negative about the overall dining experience. Therefore, a reasonable assumption was made that ratings above 3 are deemed as positive reviews, whereas ratings below 3 (inclusive) are deemed as negative reviews. "

    "As we can see from the results of the experiments, the accuracy that the model with self-trained word vectors could reach is around 84%, whereas the accuracy that the model with pre-trained word vectors could reach is around 80%.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "There are several ways that we could further try to see if we could improve the performance of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Scrape more data\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Design word vectors with even higher dimensions. Higher dimensions of word vectors means that more latent features of words would be detected. However, this would require more training time and more space in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Enlarge the instances of word vectors. In this project, we narrowed down to 6000 most frequent words for training the word vectors, which took around 50 minutes. We could further enlarge the instances up to 10000 or more. More words in word vectors means that more information could be gathered by the algorithm when doing sentiment analysis. By enlarging the instances of word vectors, more training time and space would be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Enlarge the context size when training word vectors. Larger context size means that the algorithm could better figure out the context of a given word and thus yield a word vector which could better represent the given word.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Tune hyperparameter of the model for training word vectors, such as balance factor, threshold, drop-out probability, score(weight factor), learning rate, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Tune hyperparameter of the model for sentiment analysis, such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, etc.\n"
